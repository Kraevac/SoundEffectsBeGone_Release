# DEMONATA GAMING MOD METADATA LICENSE v1.0  
_Last Updated: 2025-08-02_

This license applies to the **original metadata structures, documentation formats, and organizational logic** created by **Demonata Gaming** for use in XML-based game modding projects, including (but not limited to) those developed for _7 Days to Die_.

## üéØ PROTECTED CONTENT

The following components are **protected under this license** and may **not** be reused, modified, or redistributed‚Äîpublicly or privately‚Äî**without clear attribution**:

- Structured metadata blocks and top-of-file headers:  
  `@version`, `@date`, `@group`, `@description`, `@xref`, `@notes`
- Comment-based section headers and formatting syntax:  
  `<!-- ==================== SECTION: EXAMPLE ==================== -->`
- In-line documentation style, explanation language, and formatting
- Cross-referencing conventions between files:  
  `@xref file.xml ‚Üí Section Name`
- Naming systems for patch sections, mod groups, or internal IDs
- Logical file structure and organizational methodology (e.g. by biome, difficulty, time-of-day, etc.)

These elements are **original to Demonata Gaming** and are **not part of the vanilla XML schema** provided by the game developer or general modding APIs.

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT YOU **CAN** USE

You are free to:

- Use standard XML syntax and modding structures
- Reference vanilla game data (entity names, values, loot tables, etc.)
- Apply similar logic or functions (e.g., modifying recipes, spawn rates)
- Develop your own documentation or metadata systems
- Learn from this mod‚Äôs structure for private use or experimentation

This license **does not** restrict your ability to:
- Create similar mods from scratch
- Build on public modding knowledge
- Share similar ideas in new and original formats

Just don‚Äôt copy the *how* unless you credit the *who*.

You can include this:
- In your README
- In top-of-file comments
- On your mod‚Äôs description page
