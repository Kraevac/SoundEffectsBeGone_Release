## 📦 Modlet Name
Sound Effects Be Gone

## 🆚 Version
`v1.0.0`  
**Date:** 2025-08-08

---

## 📘 Description

Removes the sounds effects that occur when entering hazardous biomes like Wasteland, Snow, and Desert. The biome hazard buffs still apply—but without the distracting sound effects.

Ideal for players who dislike who want less grunts but want to keep the biome challenge intact.

---

## 🎯 Features
- Removes all `onSelfBuffStart` sound triggers from biome hazard buffs
- No more pain, cold, hot, or giger counter sounds while exploring
- Core hazard mechanics (e.g., biome DOT effects) remain fully intact

---

## ✅ Compatibility
- Game Version: 2.0 (or later)
- Compatible with:
  - Vanilla
  - Most overhauls (unless they radically overhaul buff structure)
  - Screen Effects Be Gone(https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/8238)
- Safe to add/remove mid-save (no custom assets or classes)

---

## ⚠️ Notes / Warnings
- This does **not** remove the biome damage or hazard effects—only the screen tints.
- Compatible with other buff mods unless they override the exact same intensity values.
